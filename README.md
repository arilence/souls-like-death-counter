# Souls-Like Death Counter

Created for [SmawlGiant's Twitch Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/smawlgiant)

This application aims to automatically track death counts among various souls-like games. The number of deaths is saved and continuously updated to a text file for easy access into OBS or other streaming softwares.

It currently works with: DARK SOULS: Prepare To Die Edition, and DARK SOULS: REMASTERED.

I acknowledge there are other applications which achieve a similar goal by reading the processes memory. For fun I have opted to read and parse the games save file to retrieve the death count.
